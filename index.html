  <h1>Deng Mawut Kut My Life as a Footballer</h1>

<p>
My name is <strong>Deng Mawut Kut</strong>, and football is not just a sport to me it is a big part 
of who I am. I started playing when I was young, and ever since then, I have loved the 
feeling of being on the field. Football teaches discipline, teamwork, and confidence. 
When I play, I feel focused, determined, and full of energy. I enjoy training, learning 
new skills, and improving my speed and strength. Whether I’m dribbling, passing, or 
scoring goals, football always makes me happy. My dream is to continue getting better 
and one day play at a professional level. Football motivates me to work hard, stay fit, 
and never give up on my goals.
